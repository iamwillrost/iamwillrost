Purpose driven projects tend to be the most motivating.
I believe all people _should_ be empowered by a computer science education.
I am still teaching myself programming, I'm studied in business...
My other interests include education, cats, money, business, cybersecurity, privacy, research.
I enrolled in an accelerated full stack development program to teach myself coding skills. That's a waste of money.
